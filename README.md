# SuperMarket_Billing_System
In this project I have created a c++ project in which we create a database text file containing products.
There are two different users -- "Administrator" and "Buyer".
The administrator can add product in text file and the buyer can select products code and the quantity they want to buy.
Administrator -- E-Mail[rahul@mail.com] , Password[Rahul@123].
